This paragraph will have different styles of links that RST supports. Such as `External Hyperlink Targets`_. Also the embedded URI format, details found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris>`_.

We will also need to test internal hyperlink targets. Like linking to the `Inline Styles`_ section. I wonder if the embedded URI format will for for this `Test Link <Emphasis>`_ (It Treats it as a URI so I guess it doesn't).
