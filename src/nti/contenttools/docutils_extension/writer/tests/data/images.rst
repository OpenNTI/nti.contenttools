Images and Figures
------------------

Images can be treated as a block by just using its directive:

.. image:: images/block.png

Or if you want them to show up in line like |inlineimage|, you can use a Substitution Reference and Definition.

.. |inlineimage| image:: images/sub.png

.. figure:: images/figure.png
	:alt: figure alt text
	:align: left

	Figure caption

	This is the figure legend
